BotTastic - Mesh Bot

This is the documentation for BotTastic, a bot I wrote for Meshtastic network.

The website is totally based on CTMesh.org.  I don't have time or skills to make a nice looking web page. CTMesh.org as marked with a CC license, so I felt appropriate to borrow / customize. Hopefully won't be pissing off anyone.
