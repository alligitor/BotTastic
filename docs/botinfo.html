      <br><br>Background<br>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      I started working on BotTastic for the Meshtastic radio network starting in January 2025.
      <br>After finding Meshtastic I ordered a node, flashed the firmware, started it up, and happily wanted
      to participate and connect.
      However, I realized that, mostly due to how meshtastic works, finding other nodes is difficult.
      <br>As a new commer, you don't know what's going on.
      <br>Am I not hearing anyone because there's no one around?
      <br>Have I misconfigured something?
      <br>The early days were frustrating.
      <br>I also noticed that most other folks are in the same situation. The primary public channel has a 
      constent stream of: hello, test, testing, anybody there...
      So, here's an auto responder bot.
    </div>

    <div class="text-content-b">
      <br><br>BotTastic<br>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
	      BotTastic started as a simple robot that has the goal of helping folks test their radio and figure out
      if their radio is working.
      <p>It now has a few commands for connection tests, daily joke, and some public services such as finding whether you have a duplicate key.
      <br>The following is the list of commands.  Check this often for new commands.
    </div>

    <div class="text-content-b">
      <br><br>Commands<br>
    </div>

    <div class="text-content">
      <b>test</b>A message is sent addressed to the sender. Content changes.
      <b>testing</b>A message is sent addressed to the sender. Content changes.
      <b>radio check</b>A message is sent addressed to the sender. Content changes.
      <b>antenna check</b>A message is sent addressed to the sender. Content changes.
      <b>echo</b>Repeats everything after the word echo back addressed to the sender.
      <b>fortune</b>A random joke from a list of one-liners collected on internet.
      <b>distance</b>Calculates the distance to the user, if they have a location set.
      <b>history</b>Returns the last few messages received on the channel. Very useful in comparing what the bot saw on the channel vs. what the user saw.  You can also use this, in a DM, to do distance testing. Send unique messages from different locations, come back to range, issue history and see what was received.
      <p>This has two main uses.
      <p>Send it on the public channel to get a list of messages there.  So you know if there are messages you missed.
      <p>Send, up to 5, as DM from different locations.  Then from a spot where you know you have connectivity, DM the history command.  The bot will DM you back the last five messages.  This way, you can see what locations resulted in a successful delivery.
      <p>Remember, due to how Meshtastic limits number of hops a message can take, what you see could be very different than what the bot sees.
      <p>All the traffic I see on public channel is logged to a page for your view.  You can compare your history of the channel to mine.
      <p><a href="https://www.bottastic.org/botmessagelog.html" target="https://www.bottastic.org/botmessagelog.html" rel="noopener">Public Channel Message History</a>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <b>pubkeydupcheck</b>Compares your public key to all the other nodes that the bot knows about for a match.  Meshtastic has now updated the phone apps and the radio firmware to help detect this but the bot can also help you do a local check.  BotTastic only knows the nodes it hears from so feel free to run it often.  If there is a duplicate, you can get the new phone app and regenerate your key from Settings->Security.
      <b>Important</b>At the moment, for various reasons, Meshtastic only updates the public key when a node is first found.  Subsequent updates to the key are not accepted.  The only way to refresh the keys is to delete a node and let it be found again with the new key. This is an issue with Meshtastic firmware.
      <p>Impacts to you:
      <p>You might regenerate your key and ask the bot to do a duplicate check.  It might still flag your key as duplicate because it doesn't have your updated key. Check your new key against the link below. If the key shown in your app is different than whats listed, ignore the message and wait until bot's keys are updated.
      <p><b>deleteme</b> - Command to force the bot to delete your node. This is meant to bypass Meshtastic's key update policy.  Force a delete and let the bot learn your new key.
      <p>Bot might tell you it doesn't know your key. Most likely, it deleted all the learned nodes and is in the process of finding them again.  Wait until it learns about your node.  This learning process is 100% based on how Meshtastic works and there's no way to speed it up. You can try sending the bot a DM. Sometimes it kicks Meshtastic into exchanging keys.
      <p>I suggest checking often. It might not find a duplicate key for you today, but might find one as it learns about more nodes.
      <p>Also, you might just ignore this whole duplicate key problem if you are not doing anything super secret over DM.

      <p><b>Word on Meshtastic Encryption</b>
      <p>Meshtastic doesn't have the most secure encryption mechanism. Don't count on it as you might on other things.  Yes, they do use encryption but devil is in the details.
      <p>In their words: "Is it as secure as Wi-Fi WPA3, HTTPS TLS1.3, or Signal?  <b>No.</b>"
      <p>Feel free to look at their own page on this topic:
      <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/encryption/" target="https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/encryption/"noopener">Meshtastic Encryption</a>
      <p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <br><br>All these commands work over the public channel and direct messaging. The output could be slightly different though. On public channel, responses are addressed to the original sender.
      <p><b>Hop Count</b>
      <p>In responding to messages, the bot has two goals:
      <p> Make sure the response gets to the original sender.
      <p> Reduce unnecessary propagation of packets through out the mesh.
      <p> Therefore, it uses hop limits cleverly.  It calculates the number of hops the original message took to get to the bot and marks the out going packet with a similar hop limit.  This increases the chances of the original sender receiving a reply and the rest of the mesh not.  For example, if a "test" request is received with 2 hops, the reply goes back with a limit of 3 hops.
      <p> As a result, it's very possible that different nodes in the mesh see only the original "test" message, the resopnse, or hopefully both.
    </div>

    <div class="text-content">
      <b>Chit Chat</b>BotTastic will also be happy to engage is brainless chit-chat.  This can be done as DMs, or on the public channel if the message is addressed directly by using @265e.
      <br>If you want someone to say Good Morning back, either DM your message, or prepend it with  @265e: on the public channel.
      <br>for example: @265e: Good Morning
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <br>There are also other commands coming, to help people perform connection detection.
    </div>    

    <div class="text-content">
      <b>Mesh Statistics</b>Although we mostly see the text messages, Meshtastic generates alot of background packets. This bot is collecting the packets it sees to get a feel for how many packets are flying around.
